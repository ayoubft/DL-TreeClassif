# Classification of a specific tree using CNN

This work will illustrate the workflow done from a image (`.tif`) of a forest, to determine the specific type of a tree.

Cropped single images of individual trees from an RGB orthomosaic from UAV imagery, then trained a multiclass classifier using CNN.
